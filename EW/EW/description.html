        <h1>About Eco Bin</h1>
        <p>
            Eco Bin is an innovative IoT-based smart waste management system designed to tackle the challenges of modern urban waste collection. By utilizing advanced sensors and real-time monitoring, it ensures efficient and hygienic waste disposal while reducing environmental impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system classifies waste into degradable and non-degradable categories using camera-based technology, promoting effective segregation at the source. When the bin reaches 70% capacity, a compression mechanism is activated to optimize storage space. Upon reaching 90% capacity, Eco Bin sends alerts with GPS location details to municipal authorities, ensuring timely waste collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Powered by solar energy, Eco Bin operates sustainably, reducing reliance on traditional power sources. Its integration with IoT communication systems allows for efficient route planning and reduced fuel consumption during waste collection. Additionally, features like automated lid operation and secure design enhance public hygiene and prevent tampering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eco Bin represents a significant step towards creating smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable urban spaces, making it a vital component of modern smart city initiatives.
